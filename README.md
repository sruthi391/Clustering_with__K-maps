# K-Means Clustering for Mall Customer Segmentation

## Objective
This project aims to perform unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset, which contains information about mall customers including Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).

## Tools and Libraries
* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For data loading and manipulation.
* **Scikit-learn:** For K-Means clustering and data preprocessing (StandardScaler).
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
* **Numpy:** For numerical operations.

## Project Structure
* `main.py`: The Python script containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
* `Mall_Customers.csv`: The input dataset.
* `elbow_method.png`: Plot generated by the Elbow Method to determine optimal K.
* `silhouette_scores.png`: Plot showing Silhouette Scores for different K values.
* `customer_clusters.png`: Scatter plot visualizing the customer clusters.
* `Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`: The preprocessed data with assigned cluster labels.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Loading and Inspection:**
    * The `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Initial inspection of the data helps understand its structure and identify relevant features.

2.  **Feature Selection and Scaling:**
    * The 'Annual Income (k$)' and 'Spending Score (1-100)' features were selected for clustering, as they are key indicators for customer segmentation.
    * These features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that features with larger values do not dominate the clustering process.

3.  **Optimal K Determination (Elbow Method & Silhouette Score):**
    * **Elbow Method:** The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) was calculated for a range of K values (2 to 10). The 'elbow' in the SSE vs. K plot indicates a suitable number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly decrease the SSE.
    * **Silhouette Score:** The Silhouette Score was calculated for the same range of K values. This metric assesses how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher Silhouette Score indicates better-defined clusters.
    * Based on both methods, `K=5` was identified as the optimal number of clusters for this dataset.

4.  **K-Means Clustering:**
    * The K-Means algorithm was applied with `n_clusters=5`.
    * Each customer was assigned a cluster label based on the clustering results.

5.  **Cluster Visualization:**
    * A scatter plot was generated to visualize the clusters, with 'Annual Income (k$)' on the x-axis and 'Spending Score (1-100)' on the y-axis.
    * Each data point is color-coded according to its assigned cluster, making the segmentation clear.

6.  **Evaluation:**
    * The Silhouette Score for the final clustering with K=5 was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the clustering quality.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Ensure you have the required libraries installed:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
    ```
2.  **Place the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset in the same directory as the `main.py` file.**
3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  The script will output information about the dataset to the console and generate three image files (`elbow_method.png`, `silhouette_scores.png`, `customer_clusters.png`) and one CSV file (`Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`) in the same directory.

## Interview Questions

Here are some common interview questions related to K-Means clustering, along with their answers:

1.  **How does K-Means clustering work?**
    K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition $n$ observations into $k$ clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). It works iteratively:
    * **Initialization:** Randomly select $k$ centroids.
    * **Assignment Step:** Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
    * **Update Step:** Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
    * These two steps (assignment and update) are repeated until the centroids no longer move significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

2.  **What is the Elbow method?**
    The Elbow Method is a heuristic used to determine the optimal number of clusters ($K$) for K-Means clustering. It plots the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), also known as inertia, against the number of clusters ($K$). The WCSS generally decreases as $K$ increases. The "elbow" point on the graph, where the rate of decrease in WCSS sharply changes, is considered the optimal $K$, as adding more clusters beyond this point does not significantly reduce the WCSS.

3.  **What are the limitations of K-Means?**
    * **Sensitivity to Initialization:** The random initialization of centroids can lead to different clustering results.
    * **Requires Pre-defined K:** The number of clusters ($K$) must be specified beforehand, which is often challenging.
    * **Assumes Spherical Clusters:** K-Means works best with clusters that are spherical and equally sized, and it struggles with clusters of irregular shapes or varying densities.
    * **Sensitivity to Outliers:** Outliers can significantly affect cluster centroids and thus the clustering results.
    * **Difficulty with Non-Global Optimality:** It can converge to a local optimum rather than the global optimum.

4.  **How does initialization affect results?**
    The initial placement of centroids can significantly impact the final clustering results. A poor initialization might lead to slow convergence or convergence to a suboptimal clustering. Techniques like K-Means++ are used to address this by choosing initial centroids that are spread out, leading to more consistent and often better results.

5.  **What is inertia in K-Means?**
    Inertia, also known as the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), measures how well a dataset is clustered by K-Means. It is the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid. A lower inertia generally indicates a better clustering, as it means data points are closer to their respective centroids.

6.  **What is Silhouette Score?**
    The Silhouette Score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering. For each data point, it measures how similar that point is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The score ranges from -1 to 1:
    * **Scores close to 1:** Indicate that the data point is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
    * **Scores close to 0:** Indicate that the data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.
    * **Scores close to -1:** Indicate that the data point is likely assigned to the wrong cluster.
    The overall Silhouette Score for a clustering is the average of the Silhouette Scores for all data points.

7.  **How do you choose the right number of clusters?**
    Choosing the right number of clusters ($K$) is crucial. Common methods include:
    * **Elbow Method:** As discussed above, by plotting WCSS against K.
    * **Silhouette Score:** Choosing the K that maximizes the average Silhouette Score.
    * **Domain Knowledge:** Utilizing prior knowledge or business requirements to determine meaningful clusters.
    * **Gap Statistic:** Compares the WCSS of the clustered data to that of a reference uniform distribution.

8.  **Whatâ€™s the difference between clustering and classification?**
    * **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning):** Aims to group data points into clusters such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. There are no pre-defined labels, and the algorithm discovers patterns and structures in the data.
    * **Classification (Supervised Learning):** Aims to assign data points to pre-defined categories or classes based on labeled training data. The algorithm learns a mapping from input features to output labels.
